GRTensor TODO
==============

Packaging
=========

- check install instructions, help, some basic worksheets
- create some info on table of contents in help?
- update the Latex files and regenerate (as PDF?)
- move HELP HTML onto gitlab public pages


Open Beta Prep
==============
nprotate() example - not getting same tetrad to start with 
(had to change nptetrad to [t,r])

Do the caveats w.r.t I (sqrt(-1)) in the nptetrad help still apply?

 
Work through the help pages (Info)
- eta(bup,bup) display as array is crowded

Add geodesic equation as an operator on a vector
- prompt for +/-1, 0 ?

Support email in ?grtensor ??

Notes:
======

Using module debug discovered the macros features in tensor definitions
are not happening properly when these files are included in a module
definition.

Will need a python script to modify all these files...

autoload is not used. Now just load ALL object definitions into a single library.

grG_multipleDefs: How does this work?
- multiple definitions are put into grG_multipleDef in object definitions
- these are checked in cmd_sup.mpl
  * the field grC_useWhen is checked to see if the definition appliesgrclear
  * these relies on a grF_useWhen_tetrad or or grF_useWhen_SpinorInvar


Next:
=====

Keep working through the worksheets...


Issues:
grload:
  grG_ricciFlat||gname := false:
  grG_weylFlat||gname := false:
grG_kvector ?
grdef having issues with kdelta() functions.



Definition in grdefine may be the root of the problem.

Tests
=====
> grdef("G2{a b} := R{a b} -(1/2) * Ricciscalar*g{a b} +lambda*g{a b}");
- works




BUGS
====


find all path manipulations and use FileTools:-JoinPath()
grcomponent has some issues and needs fixing
create.mpl has old concat based junk in it. 
grC_ZERO will be broken - use $define?
schwbasis.mws also
