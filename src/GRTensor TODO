GRTensor TODO
==============

Packaging
=========
- how to add metric path and libpath to .mapleinit
- add a make distro target - use it to copy stuff across from 
  GRTensorIII into grtensor repo
- check install instructions, help, some basic worksheets
- create some info on table of contents in help?

Open Beta Prep
==============
help library
put metrics and worksheets in place
vet the worksheets


Notes:
======

Using module debug discovered the macros features in tensor definitions
are not happening properly when these files are included in a module
definition.

Will need a python script to modify all these files...

autoload is not used. Now just load ALL object definitions into a single library.

grG_multipleDefs: How does this work?
- multiple definitions are put into grG_multipleDef in object definitions
- these are checked in cmd_sup.mpl
  * the field grC_useWhen is checked to see if the definition applies
  * these relies on a grF_useWhen_tetrad or or grF_useWhen_SpinorInvar


Next:
=====

Keep working through the worksheets...


Issues:
grload:
  grG_ricciFlat||gname := false:
  grG_weylFlat||gname := false:
grG_kvector ?
grdef having issues with kdelta() functions.



Definition in grdefine may be the root of the problem.

Tests
=====
> grdef("G2{a b} := R{a b} -(1/2) * Ricciscalar*g{a b} +lambda*g{a b}");
- works




BUGS
====
1) kdelta
>grdef ( "v{^a} := kdelta( x{^a}, t)" ):
kdelta does not evaluate
This is an existing BUG

2) RicciSc
- have issue with Lambda - no def (but in fact there are multiple defs)

find all path manipulations and use FileTools:-JoinPath()
grcomponent has some issues and needs fixing
create.mpl has old concat based junk in it. 
nptetrad.mpl likewise
objects/diffop.mpl
objects/basis.mpl
grC_ZERO will be broken - use $define?
