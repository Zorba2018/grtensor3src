GRTensor TODO
==============

- groptions not initied
- auto init on module load

Open Beta Prep
==============
help library
put metrics and worksheets in place
vet the worksheets
get code for sub-libraries

Can grdef accept back ticks and convert to string?

Notes:
======

Using module debug discovered the macros features in tensor definitions
are not happening properly when these files are included in a module
definition.

Will need a python script to modify all these files...

g(dn,dn,pdn) values are not accesible to other calc functions
- confusingly they do display correctly...


Migration to gr_data to hold ALL component results:

Next:
=====

Convert sub-libraries
Make sure name aliasing is ok. 
Keep working through the worksheets...


Issues:
grload:
  grG_ricciFlat||gname := false:
  grG_weylFlat||gname := false:
grG_kvector ?
grdef having issues with kdelta() functions.



Definition in grdefine may be the root of the problem.

Tests
=====
> grdef("G2{a b} := R{a b} -(1/2) * Ricciscalar*g{a b} +lambda*g{a b}");
- works

Packaging
=========
- how to add metric path and libpath to .mapleinit



BUGS
====
1) kdelta
>grdef ( "v{^a} := kdelta( x{^a}, t)" ):
kdelta does not evaluate
This is an existing BUG

2) RicciSc
- have issue with Lambda - no def (but in fact there are multiple defs)

find all path manipulations and use FileTools:-JoinPath()
grcomponent has some issues and needs fixing
create.mpl has old concat based junk in it. 
nptetrad.mpl likewise
objects/diffop.mpl
objects/basis.mpl
grC_ZERO will be broken - use $define?
