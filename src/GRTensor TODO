GRTensor TODO
==============

Packaging
=========

- check install instructions, help, some basic worksheets
- create some info on table of contents in help?
- update the Latex files and regenerate (as PDF?)

Open Beta Prep
==============
help library
put metrics and worksheets in place
vet the worksheets


Notes:
======

Using module debug discovered the macros features in tensor definitions
are not happening properly when these files are included in a module
definition.

Will need a python script to modify all these files...

autoload is not used. Now just load ALL object definitions into a single library.

grG_multipleDefs: How does this work?
- multiple definitions are put into grG_multipleDef in object definitions
- these are checked in cmd_sup.mpl
  * the field grC_useWhen is checked to see if the definition applies
  * these relies on a grF_useWhen_tetrad or or grF_useWhen_SpinorInvar


Next:
=====

Keep working through the worksheets...


Issues:
grload:
  grG_ricciFlat||gname := false:
  grG_weylFlat||gname := false:
grG_kvector ?
grdef having issues with kdelta() functions.



Definition in grdefine may be the root of the problem.

Tests
=====
> grdef("G2{a b} := R{a b} -(1/2) * Ricciscalar*g{a b} +lambda*g{a b}");
- works




BUGS
====
1) kdelta
>grdef ( "v{^a} := kdelta( x{^a}, t)" ):
kdelta does not evaluate
This is an existing BUG

2) RicciSc
- have issue with Lambda - no def (but in fact there are multiple defs)
- seems to have become a RicciSc bug.. Some components that should be zero are not.

3) PetrovReport is not shown

4) Intro WS the C(bdn,bdn,bup,bup) symmetries on display are wrong (showing too many components)

5) rnds1: nptetrad dialog is missing prompt.

find all path manipulations and use FileTools:-JoinPath()
grcomponent has some issues and needs fixing
create.mpl has old concat based junk in it. 
grC_ZERO will be broken - use $define?
schwbasis.mws also
