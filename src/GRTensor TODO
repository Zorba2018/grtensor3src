GRTensor TODO
==============

Packaging
=========

- check install instructions, help, some basic worksheets
- create some info on table of contents in help?
- update the Latex files and regenerate (as PDF?)
- move HELP HTML onto gitlab public pages


Open Beta Prep
==============
nprotate() example - not getting same tetrad to start with 
(had to change nptetrad to [t,r])

Do the caveats w.r.t I (sqrt(-1)) in the nptetrad help still apply?

 
Work through the help pages (Info)
- eta(bup,bup) display as array is crowded

Intro book:
- WeySc Psi 1/2 for NP example are close - but do not match the doc!!	
 * if change to noparam or reverse param list, then get a different Petrov type. IS that a bug?
 * need to try with the old grtensor
 
Calc book: ok

Basis Book:
- made fixes (see commit)

grdef Book:
- error in def with Box
- better to just calc Box[T1(dn,dn)]
	grdef("X := R{^a ^b}*Box[R{a b}]");
	Indices in name: [[], []]
	Indices in definition: [[a, b], []]
	Error, (in grtensor:-grdef) lhs/rhs index conflict.
	grdef("T{a b} := Box[T{a b}]");
	Indices in name: [[], [a, b]]
	Indices in definition: [[], []]
	Error, (in grtensor:-grdef) lhs/rhs index conflict.

BUG - def/assign B{[a b]}
      clear and re-assign
      lower diagonal will old values due to:
      gr_data[root, grG_metricName, grG_operands, a2_, a1_] := -gr_data[root, grG_metricName, grG_operands, a1_, a2_]
      with RHS still on old values. 
      Can evaln() help here?

TODO
====
Add geodesic equation as an operator on a vector
- prompt for +/-1, 0 ?

Support email address in ?grtensor ??

Notes:
======

Using module debug discovered the macros features in tensor definitions
are not happening properly when these files are included in a module
definition.

Will need a python script to modify all these files...

autoload is not used. Now just load ALL object definitions into a single library.

grG_multipleDefs: How does this work?
- multiple definitions are put into grG_multipleDef in object definitions
- these are checked in cmd_sup.mpl
  * the field grC_useWhen is checked to see if the definition appliesgrclear
  * these relies on a grF_useWhen_tetrad or or grF_useWhen_SpinorInvar


Next:
=====

Keep working through the worksheets...


Issues:
grload:
  grG_ricciFlat||gname := false:
  grG_weylFlat||gname := false:
grG_kvector ?
grdef having issues with kdelta() functions.



Definition in grdefine may be the root of the problem.

Tests
=====
> grdef("G2{a b} := R{a b} -(1/2) * Ricciscalar*g{a b} +lambda*g{a b}");
- works




BUGS
====


find all path manipulations and use FileTools:-JoinPath()
grcomponent has some issues and needs fixing
create.mpl has old concat based junk in it. 
grC_ZERO will be broken - use $define?
schwbasis.mws also
