GRTensor TODO
==============

Junction
========
Check normal vectors and calculation of K(dn,dn)
Get correct results and then optimize the workflow!
- why does Kdnup have an "r" in it? Where did this creep in? - juncF_project was bypassed. Now doing stuff...
Eric uses [gij] to get a constraint, grj uses u{^a}u{a} (this also assumes u{^i} = [0,0,1] ?! This is not clear)

- defining u() and n() might be annoying for users (plus conflict with existing docs...)

Packaging
=========


Open Beta Prep
==============
Eric's bug
- direct calc of v(dn,pdn) is ok. 
- other pdn extensions (e.g. g(dn,dn,pdn)) are ok

nprotate() example - not getting same tetrad to start with 
(had to change nptetrad to [t,r])

Do the caveats w.r.t I (sqrt(-1)) in the nptetrad help still apply?

 
Intro book:
- WeySc Psi 1/2 for NP example are close - but do not match the doc!!	
 * if change to noparam or reverse param list, then get a different Petrov type. IS that a bug?
 * need to try with the old grtensor
 
Calc book: ok

Basis Book:
- made fixes (see commit)

grdef Book:
- restrict indices is not working
(comment out of doc/help for now)

Fix up help_griii.mpl and add to Makefile (do this as part of distrib)

LATEX HINTS:
============
Latex -> trash aux files
run Latex
run Bibtex
run Latex
run Latex
and only then will references be ok. 



TODO
====
Add geodesic equation as an operator on a vector
- prompt for +/-1, 0 ?

Support email address in ?grtensor ??

Notes:
======

Using module debug discovered the macros features in tensor definitions
are not happening properly when these files are included in a module
definition.

Will need a python script to modify all these files...

autoload is not used. Now just load ALL object definitions into a single library.

grG_multipleDefs: How does this work?
- multiple definitions are put into grG_multipleDef in object definitions
- these are checked in cmd_sup.mpl
  * the field grC_useWhen is checked to see if the definition appliesgrclear
  * these relies on a grF_useWhen_tetrad or or grF_useWhen_SpinorInvar


Next:
=====

Keep working through the worksheets...


Issues:
grload:
  grG_ricciFlat||gname := false:
  grG_weylFlat||gname := false:
grG_kvector ?
grdef having issues with kdelta() functions.



Definition in grdefine may be the root of the problem.

Tests
=====
> grdef("G2{a b} := R{a b} -(1/2) * Ricciscalar*g{a b} +lambda*g{a b}");
- works



BUGS
====
grC_ZERO will be broken - use $define?
schwbasis.mws also
