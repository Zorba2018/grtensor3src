Can grdef accept back ticks and convert to string?

Notes:
======

Using module debug discovered the macros features in tensor definitions
are not happening properly when these files are included in a module
definition.

Will need a python script to modify all these files...

g(dn,dn,pdn) values are not accesible to other calc functions
- confusingly they do display correctly...


Migration to gr_data to hold ALL component results:

Next:
=====

Get nptetrad() example working. 
Check makeg with basis functions

Move grG_sig_ to gr_data[sig_]?

Convert and test killing
Convert nptetrad()
Enter a basis function with makeg


Issues:
grload:
  grG_ricciFlat||gname := false:
  grG_weylFlat||gname := false:
grG_kvector ?
grdef having issues with kdelta() functions.



Definition in grdefine may be the root of the problem.

Tests
=====
> grdef("G2{a b} := R{a b} -(1/2) * Ricciscalar*g{a b} +lambda*g{a b}");
- works

BUGS
====
1) kdelta
>grdef ( "v{^a} := kdelta( x{^a}, t)" ):
kdelta does not evaluate
This is an existing BUG

2) cktest worksheet
- issue with direct assignment of vectors with grdef


find all path manipulations and use FileTools:-JoinPath()
grcomponent has some issues and needs fixing
create.mpl has old concat based junk in it. 
nptetrad.mpl likewise
objects/diffop.mpl
objects/basis.mpl
grC_ZERO will be broken - use $define?
