GRTensorIII Source code, release notes and build procedure

This repo holds the source code for GRTensorIII package for Maple

For installation and usage see the Wiki tab on the GITLAB page
==============================================================================

The code has been restructured to reside in a single Maple module, grtensor.

The Module is defined in build/griii.mpl

The Makefile will run the build/griii.mpl using command line Maple provided
that the Makefile has been edited to have the correct paths. 

The use of a Module/Package in Maple required re-scoping of many of the internal
variables used in GRTensor. Briefly:
- all component info is now in gr_data[<root>, <metric>, etc.]
- spacetime dimension is in Ndim[<metric>]
- active metric is grG_metricName


If you're interested in hacking around in the source code there are
some old notes describing GRTensorII source in the file doc/grtensor.notes.

The code structure has changed into a single module, but much of the structure
of the code as described there is still relevant.
